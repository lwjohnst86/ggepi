# ggepi

[![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lwjohnst86/ggepi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lwjohnst86/ggepi)

The main goal of the ggepi package is to provide ggplot2 layers for common
statistical graphics (at least in chronic disease epidemiology and at least
what I use often). The ggepi package is as hands off as possible. This package
assumes what you want to plot is what you want to plot, and lets you have full
control over how the plot of the results looks like. 

# Installation

Install the developmental version using:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("lwjohnst86/ggepi")
```

# Usage

Check out the [website](http://ggepi.lukewjohnston.com) for more details on usage.
